# AdventOfCode2018
This is [my](https://github.com/Zizafitz) solution to the puzzle, [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com).
It's written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) with [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

I'm doing this to create code in a new language and at the same time find out how github works. But also to follow and help [Santa Claus](https://santaclausvillage.info/) in the puzzle.
